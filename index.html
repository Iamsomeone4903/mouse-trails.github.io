        <h1>Mouse Trails</h1>
        <p>Mouse trails are trails that are left by the mouse moving through the page. 
            On the right, you can see a project I made using the Scratch website. It replicates the a mouse trails. 
            Mouse trails can be quite satysfying to use when you move you mouse very slowly, but it bugs a lot when you shake your mouse very fast.
             You can make a project like seen on the right in the Scratch website. You can enable trails like these if you follow these steps: <br>
        <br>For Windows:<br>
        <br> Click the windows logo key and the I key at the same time. In the Settings app, select devices. Click the mouse option. 
        Below Related settings in the right column, select Additional mouse options.
         A little window called Mouse Properties will pop up, then select the Pointer Options tab.
         In the Visibility column tick the box called Display pointer trails.
          Now you can edit your trail! You can close the window by clicking the big X on top. <br>
        <br> For MacOs:<br>
        <br> Go to System Preferances. Then click Accessibility. Click the Display and then click Pointer. Have fun experimenting!<br>
        <br>Now that you know how to get your mouse trails, have fun!
